# Moduino

Moduino is a JavaScript modification system for the public forum found at http://forum.arduino.cc 
It is not my forum, just one I frequently visit. If you would like to have an optimal experience then this 
tool may be what you are looking for. Of course there will be bugs to begin with, but with your help we can create
an excellent multi browser enhancement for the forums.
