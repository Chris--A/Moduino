  ###This system is still under construction. 
  
  Its stable and ready to go, however I still need to create usage instructions on the homepage.

Once some new improvements are added, no installation may be necessary at all. However this is still only a plan.

There are currently 23 modifications available. Each mod can be disabled in the configuration.
